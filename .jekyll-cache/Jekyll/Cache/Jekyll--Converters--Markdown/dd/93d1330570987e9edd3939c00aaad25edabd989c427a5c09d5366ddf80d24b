<p>To help reinforce the skills you learned in Week 4, each of you are going to create a new shapefile. This time, youâ€™re going to be drawing the building footprint for one historic building resource identified in Kathryn Grover and Janine V. da Silva, <em>Historic Resource Study: Boston African American National Historic Site</em>. Refer to the Table of Contents for the street address and then the corresponding page numbers for more information about your building. Refer to <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/training_manual/create_vector_data/create_new_vector.html">https://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/training_manual/create_vector_data/create_new_vector.html</a> if you need a refresher on the relevant QGIS skills.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locate the building footprint in QGIS using OpenStreetMap tiles (you might need to cross-check in a browser with Google Maps).</li>
  <li>Create a new polygon shapefile</li>
  <li>In Edit mode, add a new polygon feature and draw the outline of the building footprint</li>
  <li>In the Attribute Table, create <strong>two new fields</strong> [columns]: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Name</code> [name of the house listed in the Historic Resource Study] and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOC</code> [Date of Construction]</li>
  <li>Input corresponding values for your building in the two new fields, according to the Historic Resource Study</li>
  <li>Save your edits!</li>
  <li>Open the Attribute Table and adjust the window so that you can see both the table and the building footprint on the map, then take a screenshot and include it with your Slack discussion questions for Week 5</li>
</ul>
